<h2>
<a name="the-project" class="anchor" href="#the-project"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>The Project:</h2>

<p>There are 2 sides to this project one involving a live performance and the other a sire for sharing and documenting the whole project.  The Live Performance “Arrastre” and the project website (this won’t go live until early Summer 2014)</p>

<p>Arrastre is a digital dance performance that derives its movements and concepts from computer science theory. A live performance, plus a series of workshops breaking down the science theory behind the performance, will constitute the whole programme. The programme will include data visualisation, images influenced and triggered by data from the dancers, wearable technology and choreography. The work will interpret computer science theories through dance, relating the programme to the new Computing curriculum for schools in England; devising a new methodology that could be applied as a cross-curricular approach for learning.</p>

<p>The site will consist of videos, ‘recipes’, links to the curriculum UK and others. We are hoping to make it a playground that the user can explore based on what they are looking for. Be it a particular curriculum element, type of sensor or specific piece of kit. We are very excited about be able to share all of resources including the code.  This has only be made possible because of being one of Google RISE Award winners for 2014. </p>

<a name="playground" class="anchor" href="#playground"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Playground</h2>

<p>Why have we decided to call the hack and workshop events playgrounds?  Because we want it to be open to everyone not just experts. Plus the opportunity to just mess around and tinkering with code and electronics! How more playful can you get.</p>

<h2>
<a name="why-data-visualisation" class="anchor" href="#why-data-visualisation"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Why Data Visualisation?</h2>

<p>Data and information are important parts of the new Computing Program of Study in England. By the use, modification and repurposing of large data sets. We are planning to use the D3 javascript library because of 2 reasons. 1 it is awesome and 2 we are collecting data from the dancers through out the process and want to be able to use that data in creating the visualisations.</p>

<h3>
<a name="key-stage-1" class="anchor" href="#key-stage-1"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key stage 1</h3>

<ul>
<li>understand what algorithms are; how they are implemented as programs on digital devices; and that programs execute by following precise and unambiguous instructions.</li>
<li>create and debug simple programs.</li>
<li>use logical reasoning to predict the behaviour of simple programs.</li>
<li>use technology purposefully to create, organise, store, manipulate and retrieve digital content.</li>
<li>recognise common uses of information technology beyond school.</li>
<li>use technology safely and respectfully, keeping personal information private; know where to go for help and support when they have concerns about material on the internet</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="key-stage-2" class="anchor" href="#key-stage-2"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key stage 2</h3>

<ul>
<li>design, write and debug programs that accomplish specific goals, including controlling or simulating physical systems; solve problems by decomposing them into smaller parts.</li>
<li>use sequence, selection, and repetition in programs; work with variables and various forms of input and output.</li>
<li>use logical reasoning to explain how some simple algorithms work and to detect and correct errors in algorithms and programs.</li>
<li>understand computer networks including the internet; how they can provide multiple services, such as the world-wide web; and the opportunities they offer for communication and collaboration.</li>
<li>use search technologies effectively, appreciate how results are selected and ranked, and be discerning in evaluating digital content.</li>
<li>select, use and combine a variety of software (including internet services) on a range of digital devices to accomplish given goals, including collecting, analysing, evaluating and presenting data and information.</li>
<li>use technology safely, respectfully and responsibly; recognise acceptable/unacceptable behaviour; identity a range of ways to report concerns about content and contact.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="key-stage-3" class="anchor" href="#key-stage-3"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key stage 3</h3>

<p>*design, use and evaluate computational abstractions that model the state and behaviour of real-world problems and physical systems
*understand several key algorithms that reflect computational thinking, such as ones for sorting and searching; use logical reasoning to compare the utility of alternative algorithms for the same problem</p>

<ul>
<li>use two or more programming languages, at least one of which is textual, to solve a variety of computational problems; make appropriate use of data structures such as lists, tables or arrays; design and develop modular programs that use procedures or functions</li>
<li>understand simple Boolean logic [such as AND, OR and NOT] and some of its uses in circuits and programming; understand how numbers can be represented in binary, and be able to carry out simple operations on binary numbers [for example, binary addition, and conversation between binary and decimal]</li>
<li>understand the hardware and software components that make up computer systems, and how they communicate with one another and with other systems.</li>
<li>understand how instructions are stored and executed within a computer system; understand how data of various types (including text, sounds and pictures) can be represented and manipulated digitally, in the form of binary digits.</li>
<li>undertake creative projects that involve selecting, using, and combining multiple applications, preferably across a range of devices, to achieve challenging goals, including collecting and analysing data and meeting the needs of known users.</li>
<li>create, re-use, revise and re-purpose digital artefacts for a given audience, with attention to trustworthiness, design and usability.</li>
<li>understand a range of ways to use technology safely, respectfully, responsibly and securely, including protecting their online identity and privacy; recognise inappropriate content, contact and conduct and know how to report concerns.</li>
</ul><h3>
<a name="key-stage-4" class="anchor" href="#key-stage-4"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Key stage 4</h3>

<p>All pupils must have the opportunity to study aspects of information technology and computer science at sufficient depth to allow them to progress to higher levels of study or to a professional career.</p>

<ul>
<li>develop their capability, creativity and knowledge in computer science, digital media and information technology.</li>
<li>develop and apply their analytic, problem-solving, design, and computational thinking skills.</li>
<li>understand how changes in technology affect safety, including new ways to protect their online privacy and identity, and how to identify and report a range of concerns. </li>
